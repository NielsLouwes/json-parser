## Step 1
- We need two function that each serve a specific purpose

1. lexer function - take the syntax from the JSON object and return human readable text for each char in a JSON object.
2. Parser function - create validation on the existence of specific human readable syntax expected in valid JSON. Reject any that don't follow valid JSON format.
